# Learn You Some Algebras for Glorious Good! [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/learnmath/lysa.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/learnmath/lysa)

This is a math book. We aim to take a logically rigorous, yet informal approach
to math. You can see the source for the book in the `book/` directory. To build
the project from source, you'll need most of the TeXLive packages (sorry, I
don't have a list yet).

```
git clone https://github.com/learnmath/lysa.git -b develop
cd lysa/book
make
```

The makefile is not dangerous, you can look at it if you want. It builds the
book, and generates it into a file called `lysa.pdf` in the `book/`
directory. If you have a slow computer, it might take about 30 seconds or so to
build. On a fast computer, it will take less than a second. We don't include the
PDF file in the git tree because it's a binary file, and thus causes merge
conflicts if we try to track it.
